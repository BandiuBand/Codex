# Codex Agent Framework

This repository contains a small agent execution framework and demo agents. Before running any demos, ensure Python dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To verify the demos run end-to-end, execute:

```bash
python demo/simple_agent_demo.py
```

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`, it means the `PyYAML` dependency has not been installed; running the install command above resolves it.
